# stock-trader simulator

A stock trading simulation web app. Originally utilized data from IEX, but switched to Yahoo Finance to not deal with expiring API keys. 

App includes:
- User registration and login
- Table of purchased stocks, with ability to buy already owned stocks
- Stock Quote page
- Buy and Sell stock pages
- History of trades

Nice to haves:
- Stronger password requirements
- Suggest stock ticker names when quote or buying
- Change password?
- Ability for users to add more money
